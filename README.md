# Timenweather - IN PROGRESSS

This project is still a work in progress and I will be working on improvements day by day. need not to worry. *thumbs up*

## Project Description: 

- Timenweather is a clock app showing a large list of cities across the world and their respective times. It shows the users correct time dependent on their locations. you are able to search for a specific city and if that city is in the large list of cities it will show that clock by itself for you to see, as well as, show a global map that helps you understand where that city is located.

## RoadMap: 

1. Integration of Weather API: Incorporation of weather data into the application, enabling users to obtain a glimpse of a city's current weather conditions alongside its local time.

2. Global Map Integration: Implementation of a global map feature that dynamically showcases the searched city's location, enhancing the user's geographical understanding.

3. Enhanced Navigation: Introducing the functionality to make each city entry on the page clickable, leading users to a dedicated view similar to the city search results.

4. Redesigned Layout: A planned transition from the current layout to a unique and interactive design, while maintaining the minimalistic essence of the application 

## Tech Used: 


- HTML

- CSS

- Vanilla Javascript

## Motivation: 

- Personal Utility: The desire to create a practical application that not only fulfills personal wants and needs but helps other individuals as well.

- I love creating minimalistic projects that have a purposeful functionality without unnecessary complexity.
