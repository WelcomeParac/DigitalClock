# Time'n'weather (Currently In Progress)

demo here: https://willowy-cassata-fc2741.netlify.app

## Overview: 

- Time'n'weather  is a clock app showing a large list of cities across the world and their respective times. It shows the users correct time dependent on their locations. you are also able to search for a specific city and if that city is in the list it will show that clock by itself for you to see. 

## Road Map: 

1. Adding weather api to be able to see a glimspe of a city's weather.

2. Adding global map showing the location of the city once you search for a city

3. Adding the ability to make each city on the page clickable to take you to the same view as if you were searching for a city.

4. Transitioning from vanilla javascript to react.js

5. plan to change the current layout to a more unique and interative layout that is still minimalistic. 

## What was used: 

- HTML

- CSS

- Vanilla Javascript

## Why I am intrigued in making this project: 

- I want to be able to make something that I can use myself and something that I would think other people would use. 

- I love creating semi-minimalistic or minimalistic projects that have a use case than creating complex overdone projects that have a use case but not as helpful functionality.
