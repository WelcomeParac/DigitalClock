# Time'n'weather (Currently In Progress)

Time'n'weather  is a clock app showing a large list of cities across the world and their respective times. It shows the users correct time dependent on their locations. you are also able to search for a specific city and if that city is in the list it will show that clock by itself for you to see. 

In the future, I plan on adding a weather api as well so that you can get a quick weather glimpse of that city on that very time. 

This is create in HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript. However, in the near future when I learn more about React.js I will transition it to that for simplicity. 

I love just creating big minimalistic projects that look appealing to the eye and are also information and things that I would personally use.
